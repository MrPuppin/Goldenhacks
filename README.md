Our project for Goldenhacks hackathon 2019

Nuke.me is a chrome browser extension that deletes all traces of a user from the last 10 years of browsing history.

Our original idea was to remove all brownser history, cookies, bookmarks, themes, etc.
We managed to accomplish all but removing themes and bookmarks within the hackathon, although these are functionalities that can be worked on later as we progress with the project.
